                                <p>
                                    Kuyam provides services to Users for the purpose of assisting Users in securing
                                    appointments at participating companies and independent contractors (individually,
                                    a “Company” and collectively, “Companies”). In addition, the Website provides an
                                    online calendaring service that allows Users to keep track of the events in their
                                    life. In response to a User's online request for an appointment, the Website or
                                    Kuyam’s employee directly contacts a third party Company representative or a Company’s
                                    computerized database of appointments. The availability of appointments is determined
                                    at the time of the User's query. Once an appointment is confirmed by a Company,
                                    Kuyam will provide confirmation of the appointment to the User by email and/or other
                                    means of mutually acceptable communications between Kuyam’s platform and its Users.
                                    At this time, Kuyam’s Services will be free of charge to Users; however, Kuyam may
                                    impose a service charge in the future. By using the Services, the User agrees to
                                    receive appointment confirmations by email and/or other means of mutually acceptable
                                    communications after booking an appointment through the Website.</p>

                                    2. No Show Policy</h3>
                                <p>
                                    To assist us in maintaining a consistently high level of service with the participating
                                    Companies, Users are asked to review each third party Company’s cancellation policies
                                    prior to scheduling an appointment with them through Kuyam. You may cancel your
                                    appointment online via Kuyam or call the business directly. In cases where the business
                                    has requested a credit card, there may be a cancellation charge, depending on each
                                    particular business’ individual policy. A same day cancellation, unless otherwise
                                    provided for in the Company’s cancellation policy, is a violation of Kuyam’s terms
                                    of use and will be deemed a no-show.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you are unable to keep your appointment and you fail to timely cancel the appointment,
                                    Kuyam will send you an email and/or other means of mutually acceptable communications
                                    letting you know that our records indicate that you were a no-show. By using the
                                    Services, the User agrees to receive no-show confirmations by email and/or other
                                    means of mutually acceptable communications after a business and/or the Website
                                    reports your appointment was not honored, whether or not that was in fact the case.
                                    Your Kuyam account may be terminated if you are a no-show for three appointments
                                    within the same twelve-month period. The User agrees that a final no-show determination
                                    will be made by Kuyam in its sole discretion.
                                </p>

                                    The Services are being offered to Users for the User's personal use or the use of
                                    the User's immediate family or on behalf of authorized persons. The User agrees
                                    to use the Services only to book appointments at a participating business and to
                                    honor those appointments by arriving at the business on time and paying for the
                                    services rendered. The User further agrees not to book more than one (1) appointment
                                    for a single User's personal use during any one time slot. Resale or attempted resale
                                    of appointments is prohibited, and is grounds for, among other things, cancellation
                                    of the appointment, in addition to all rights and remedies under applicable state
                                    and federal law.

                                    and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored

                                    you to engage in a Personal Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in a

                                    We will share Personally Identifiable User Information with companies on your behalf
                                    to schedule appointments that you have requested.</p>

                                    From time to time, we provide offers from particular merchants (referred to as “Kuyam
                                    Service Providers”) who, as part of the offer, request information on Kuyam customers

                                    with Kuyam, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the Kuyam Service

                                    These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending

                                    and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable User Information
                                    with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or
                                    email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer
                                    lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links,
                                    process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer
                                    service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies
                                    (“Affiliates”) with whom we have business relationships and may share your Personally
                                    Identifiable User Information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative
                                    tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information
                                    to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable,
                                    release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise, we
                                    may release an Affiliate’s information to our bank to send out a payment. We encourage
                                    Kuyam Service Providers and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy
                                    policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable User Information by such

                                    If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain,

                                    that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you
                                    access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate
                                    a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure

                                    refundable.</p>
