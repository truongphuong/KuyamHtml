        <p>founded in 2011 by Kourosh Gohar, Tony Rhoton, and Todd Zebert, what started as a man who simply wanted to get his hair cut has evolved into a fresh online scheduling platform: kuyam.</p>
        <p>with kuyam, you can easily discover and schedule appointments with your favorite beauty or fitness service providers. kuyam is also a hub to discover local non-profits.</p>
        <p>our office is in Los Angeles where we're building the first kuyam community, the team believes in an organic, friendly and collaberative company environment which celebrates the core idea of kuyam, which in Chumash means, "a meeting place where we can come together."</p>
